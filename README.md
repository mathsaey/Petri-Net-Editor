#About
This project is made by Mathijs Saey as his bachelor test at the VUB.
The code builds on the Petri Net kernel made by Nicolas Cardozo, the assistant of this project.

#Goal
The goal of this project is to add a visual representation to the Petri Net kernel, it should be possible to visually represent the elements of the Petri Net.
The Petri Net serves as a visual representation of a subjective-C system. This way a programmer using Subjective-C can analyse the relations between the different contexts and get an idea of how the system would work at runtime.
