#About
This is a visual Petri Net Editor designed for iOS. The Petri Net represents Subjective-C code.
This code builds on the Petri Net kernel from Nicol√°s Cardozo.

#Goal
The goal of this project is to add a visual representation to the current Petri Net Kernel, it should be possible to modify this Petri Net to see how the corresponding Subjective-C code would work when changes to different contexts and their dependencies are made.
